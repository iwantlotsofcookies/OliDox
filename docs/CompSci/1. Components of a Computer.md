# 1. Components of a Computer
## Chapter 2 - *Processor Performance*

### Cache

- Super fast, expensive memory
- Stores frequently accessed instructions for quick access.
- Often made up of 3 different layers
    - Layer 1 - Extremely fast but small
    - Layer 2 - Fairly fast and medium sized
    - Some CPU’s also have level 3 cache!!

### Pipelining

- Allows a CPU to fetch the next instruction before it executes the previous one.

### Cores

- ↑ number of cores, communication channels between the cores use up ↑ of the speed
- Not all software can make full use of all the cores in a CPU.

### Clock Speed

- ↑ clock speed, ↑ number of instructions processed by a CPU in a second
- ↑ clock speed, ↑ CPU temperature
- Overclocking may result in incomplete execution of instructions and power loss due to heat
