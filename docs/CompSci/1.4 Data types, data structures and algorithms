# 1.4 Data types, data structure and algorithms
## *1.4.1 Data Types*

### Normalisation

- Binary equivalent of denary standard form
- Move the decimal point until the first two numbers are either
    - 01
    - 10
- Then update the exponent to reflect the number of places the decimal point has moved!
    
## *1.4.2 Data Structures*

- Static data structures have a fixed size
- Dynamic data structures can change size

### Linked-list

- Dynamic
- Holds an ordered sequence
- Items don't need to be in contiguous data locations

> Linked lists can be traversed by following each item's next pointer until the end of the list

#### Structure

- Nodes hold:
    - Data field
    - Index
    - Pointer
