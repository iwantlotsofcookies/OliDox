# General Notes
## Array vs Linked List

| Array | Linked List |
| --- | --- |
| Static data structure | Dynamic data structure |
| Ability to have any element accessed randomly | Linked list needs to be traversed until the desired element is found |
| Contents are stored contiguously in memory | Contents may not be stored contiguously in memory |
