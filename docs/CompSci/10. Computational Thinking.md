# 3. Computational Thinking
## Chapter 47 - *Thinking Abstractly*

### Abstraction
- Removing uncessary detail from problems in order to generalise and solve them.

- The London Underground Map is a abstracted model of the actual geography of the Tube Stations.

- However it is important to consider what should and should not be abstracted when solving a problem as while this map is very useful for a tourist travelling around London, it is of little use to an engineer planning to dig tunnels for a proposed line.

### Data Abstraction
- **Queues**, **stacks**, and **trees** are also examples of abstraction. 

- They ignore how the data is actually represented in the computer and focus on how data is logically connected.


## Chapter 48 - *Thinking Ahead*
### Structured Programming
- Documenting the inputs, outputs, and precondiitons of an algorithm means that:
    1. It can be put in a library of subroutines and reused from any program.
    2. Users know what checks, if any, must be carried out before calling the algorithm.
    3. If there are no preconditions, users can be confident that necessary checks will be carried out in the subroutine itself, saving unnecessary coding.

### Caching
- Temporary storage of frequently used program instructions and data.

## Chapter 49 - *Thinking Procedurally*
### Procedural Abstraction
**Procedural abstraction** $\rightarrow$ Decomposing larger problems into sub-problems that can be solved with procedures.

When thinking procedurally:
- Don't know about how a procedure works.
- Know how the procedure is called.
- Know what arguments are passed.

Breaking down problems using this **top-down design** breaks down a problem into self contained modules or subroutines.
This makes it easier to modify and debug programs as changing modules won't affect the rest of the program.

### Hierarchy Charts
Represent the structure of a program using a upside down tree model. 

Shows how each task is decomposed until the entire program is comprised of independant modules, each only a few lines of code long.
