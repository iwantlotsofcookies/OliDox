#### Waterfall lifecycle model

1. Analysis
2. Design
3. Implementation
4. Evaluation
5. Maintenance

**SUITABLE** Very small projects which need careful supervision

**PROBLEM**  Absence of user involvement

### Spiral model

> See <span style="color:#f55d49">**waterfall lifecycle model**</span> and just picture it as a spiral :)

- Develops the software in iterative stages
- Works towards prototypes, refining it at each stage.

**SUITABLE** Large scale projects that take years to deliver

### Agile modelling

- Stages of software development are not completed in a linear sequence
- At each stage:
    - a prototype is built
    - and feedback is obtained from the user.

**SUITABLE** Smaller projects where user requirements can change

### Extreme programming

> See <span style="color:#f55d49">**agile modelling**</span> but with more releases

- Short development cycles
- Introduces checkpoints at which new customer requirements can be adopted
- Improves productivity

**SUITABLE** Large projects where there is a danger of getting sidetracked by suggested improvements

### Rapid application development

> See <span style="color:#f55d49">**agile modelling**</span>

- Workshop and focus groups to gather requirements rather than a formal requirement document
- Producing each part of the system within a strict time limit which may not be perfect but “good enough”
- Reusing any software which has already been used elsewhere.

**SUITABLE** Good for very large products that will be developed over time where both technology and user requirements are subject to change.
